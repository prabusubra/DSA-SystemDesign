# Microservices Logging:-

  In a microservices architecture, multiple independent services generate logs. Without centralized logging, debugging and monitoring can become a nightmare, as logs are scattered across different services.

 -  ðŸ’¡  **Tracing Request** 
 -  ðŸ’¡  **Real-Time** 
 -  ðŸ’¡  **Log Streaming to UI** 

## Real-Time Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

| Component              | Spring Cloud Solution                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Centralized Logging    | Logback + Logstash + ELK             |
| Tracing Requests      | Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin         |
| Real-Time Monitoring   | Micrometer + Prometheus + Grafana   |
| Log Streaming to UI    | WebSockets or REST API              |
| Security & Compliance  | Secure log storage & auditing       |

ðŸ’¡ **What is Centralized Logging?**

Centralized logging is the practice of aggregating logs from all microservices into a single location, making it easier to ***search, analyze, and monitor*** logs.

Log file --> logstash(for data processing) --> Elastic Search (for storage) --> kibana (for visualization)

â¬› ***Sleuth** adds ***trace IDs*** and ***span IDs*** to logs and propagates them across microservices.

â¬› ***Zipkin*** Use Zipkin if you need end-to-end request tracing.

## Log Aggregation Tools

| Tool                        | Purpose                    | Works With |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (ELK) | Full-text search, UI logs in Kibana, REST API | Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana |
| Loki + Promtail + Grafana   | Lightweight log aggregation | Grafana |
| Fluentd                     | Log collector & forwarder  | Elasticsearch, Cloud |
