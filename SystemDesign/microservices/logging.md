# Centralized Logging in Microservices

In a microservices architecture, multiple independent services generate logs. Without centralized logging, debugging and monitoring can become a nightmare, as logs are scattered across different services.

ðŸ’¡ **What is Centralized Logging?**

Centralized logging is the practice of aggregating logs from all microservices into a single location, making it easier to ***search, analyze, and monitor*** logs.
